# Pull Request Best Practices for OpenHealth

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMMUTABLE RULES - NO EXCEPTIONS

**These rules are NON-NEGOTIABLE and MUST be followed by every contributor.**

## üéØ Core Philosophy: Small, Focused, Testable

Every PR should be small enough to review in 5-10 minutes, focused enough to explain in one sentence, and complete enough to deploy independently.

## üî• FORK-FIRST WORKFLOW - MANDATORY

**All development MUST follow this workflow:**

### Phase 1: Develop & Test on YOUR Fork
1. **Fork Repository**: `OpenHealthForAll/open-health` ‚Üí `your-username/open-health`
2. **Create Feature Branch**: `git checkout -b feat/your-specific-change`
3. **Develop Following Size Rules**: Max 200 lines, 5 files, 30 minutes
4. **Create PR to YOUR Fork**: Test thoroughly in your environment
5. **Merge to Your Fork's Main**: Only after successful testing

### Phase 2: Contribute to Upstream (Only After Testing)
1. **Create Upstream Branch**: `git checkout -b feat/your-change-upstream upstream/main`
2. **Cherry-pick Tested Commit**: `git cherry-pick <tested-commit-hash>`
3. **Create Upstream PR**: Reference your fork's testing in description
4. **Include Testing Evidence**: Link to your fork's PR and test results

### Why Fork-First?
- ‚úÖ **Safe testing environment** - No risk to main project
- ‚úÖ **Proven contributions** - Only submit validated, working code
- ‚úÖ **Fast iteration** - Quick feedback loop on your fork
- ‚úÖ **Quality assurance** - Catch issues before upstream submission

## üìè THE GOLDEN RULES (ABSOLUTE)

### Rule 1: Size Limits (HARD LIMITS)
```yaml
MAX_LINES: 200          # Total additions + deletions - NO EXCEPTIONS
MAX_FILES: 5            # Ideally 1-3 files - STRICT LIMIT
MAX_COMMITS: 3          # Ideally 1 commit - FIRM BOUNDARY  
MAX_TIME: 30 minutes    # If longer, MUST split - NON-NEGOTIABLE
```

**VIOLATION = IMMEDIATE REJECTION**

### Rule 2: One PR = One Purpose (MANDATORY)
- ‚úÖ Each PR does **EXACTLY ONE THING**
- ‚úÖ Can be described in **ONE SENTENCE**
- ‚úÖ Addresses **SINGLE ISSUE** or feature
- ‚ùå **ZERO** "while I'm here" changes
- ‚ùå **ZERO** mixing features with fixes
- ‚ùå **ZERO** bundling unrelated changes

**VIOLATION = AUTOMATIC CLOSE**

### Rule 3: Always Deployable (REQUIRED)
- Every PR **MUST** leave app in working state
- **MUST** pass all tests (`npm run build`)
- **COULD** be deployed to production alone
- **NO** "part 1 of X" PRs allowed
- **NO** breaking changes without migration

**VIOLATION = IMMEDIATE BLOCK**

## üö® ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS

### Automatic Rejections
- **Size > 200 lines**: Auto-close with size violation notice
- **Files > 5**: Auto-close with scope violation notice
- **Mixed changes**: Auto-close with focus violation notice
- **No test instructions**: Auto-close with testing violation notice

### Review Blockers
- **Title too vague**: Must describe specific change
- **No fork testing**: Must show evidence of testing on fork
- **Multiple purposes**: Must split into separate PRs
- **Build failure**: Must fix before review

## üìä PR Size Classification (STRICT)

### Micro PR (IDEAL) üü¢
- **Lines**: 1-50
- **Files**: 1
- **Time**: 5-10 minutes
- **Review Time**: 2-3 minutes
- **Example**: Fix typo, add validation, update color

### Small PR (GOOD) üü°  
- **Lines**: 50-100
- **Files**: 2-3
- **Time**: 10-20 minutes
- **Review Time**: 5-8 minutes
- **Example**: Add utility function + use it, fix bug + test

### Medium PR (ACCEPTABLE) üü†
- **Lines**: 100-200
- **Files**: 3-5
- **Time**: 20-30 minutes
- **Review Time**: 10-15 minutes
- **Example**: Add feature to one component

### Large PR (FORBIDDEN) üî¥
- **Lines**: 200+
- **Files**: 5+
- **Time**: 30+ minutes
- **Action**: **STOP IMMEDIATELY** - Split into smaller PRs
- **Status**: **WILL BE REJECTED**

## ‚úÖ MANDATORY TESTING REQUIREMENTS

### Fork Testing Checklist
Before creating upstream PR:
- [ ] **Build passes** on your fork: `npm run build`
- [ ] **Dev server works** on your fork: `npm run dev`
- [ ] **Feature tested manually** on your fork
- [ ] **No regressions** in existing functionality
- [ ] **Performance acceptable** on your fork
- [ ] **Mobile responsive** (if UI changes)

### Upstream PR Requirements
- [ ] **Fork PR linked** in description
- [ ] **Test results documented** from fork
- [ ] **Evidence of manual testing** provided
- [ ] **Screenshot/video** if UI changes
- [ ] **Performance benchmarks** if relevant

## üìñ THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH

**These rules exist for ONE reason: To maintain a stable, maintainable, secure codebase that serves healthcare users safely.**

### Non-Negotiable Principles:
1. **Small PRs** = Fast reviews = Stable releases
2. **Fork testing** = Zero production issues  
3. **Single purpose** = Clear code history
4. **Documented testing** = Confident deployments
5. **Size limits** = Sustainable development

### Remember:
- **If you can't review it in 5 minutes, it's too big**
- **If you can't explain it in one sentence, it's doing too much**  
- **If it touches multiple areas, it should be multiple PRs**
- **If it's not tested on your fork, it's not ready for upstream**
