# OpenHealth Deployment & Testing Guide

## üß™ Testing Changes Locally

### 1. Test Mobile Responsiveness
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open browser developer tools (F12)
# Toggle device emulation (Ctrl+Shift+M or Cmd+Shift+M)
# Test on various screen sizes:
# - iPhone SE (375x667)
# - iPhone 12 Pro (390x844)
# - iPad (768x1024)
# - Desktop (1920x1080)
```

### 2. Test Health Check Endpoint
```bash
# With app running, test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Expected response:
# {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"...","services":{"database":"connected","app":"running"}}
```

### 3. Test PWA Features
1. Open Chrome/Edge on mobile device
2. Navigate to your app
3. Look for "Add to Home Screen" prompt
4. Install and test as standalone app

### 4. Test Docker Build
```bash
# Build production image
docker build -f Dockerfile.production -t openhealth:test .

# Run container
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env openhealth:test
```

## üö¢ Portainer Stack Deployment (From Git Repository)

Since you're using Portainer's "Add Stack" from repository feature, here's the correct approach:

### Option 1: Using Portainer's Git Integration

1. **In Portainer, click "Add Stack"**

2. **Choose "Repository" as build method**

3. **Fill in the form:**
   - **Name:** `openhealth`
   - **Repository URL:** `https://github.com/yourusername/open-health.git` (or your repo URL)
   - **Repository reference:** `main` (or your branch)
   - **Compose path:** `docker-compose.portainer.yaml`

4. **Add Environment Variables in Portainer:**
   Click "Add an environment variable" for each:
   ```
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=YourSecurePassword123!
   POSTGRES_USER=openhealth
   POSTGRES_DB=openhealth
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://openhealth:YourSecurePassword123!@database:5432/openhealth
   AUTH_SECRET=[generate with: openssl rand -base64 32]
   ENCRYPTION_KEY=[generate with: openssl rand -base64 32]
   NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=http://your-server-ip:3000
   DEPLOYMENT_ENV=local
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

5. **Enable features:**
   - ‚úÖ Enable auto-update (optional)
   - ‚úÖ Pull latest image changes
   
6. **Click "Deploy the stack"**

### Option 2: Using Standard docker-compose.yaml

If you prefer using the existing docker-compose.yaml:

1. **Rename for Portainer compatibility:**
   ```bash
   # On your repository
   cp docker-compose.portainer.yaml docker-compose.yml
   ```

2. **In Portainer:**
   - Repository URL: Your GitHub repo
   - Compose path: `docker-compose.yml` (Portainer prefers .yml)
   - Add same environment variables as above

- [ ] Chat interface is usable on small screens
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling issues
- [ ] Text is readable without zooming

### Docker/Portainer Testing
- [ ] Stack deploys successfully in Portainer
- [ ] All containers start and remain healthy
- [ ] Database migrations run successfully
- [ ] Health check endpoint returns 200 OK
- [ ] Application accessible on configured port
- [ ] File uploads persist in volume
- [ ] Container restarts recover gracefully

### Functional Testing
- [ ] User registration works
- [ ] Login/logout functions properly
- [ ] Chat messages send and receive
- [ ] Health data uploads process correctly

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Container Won't Start
```bash
# Check logs in Portainer or via CLI
docker service logs openhealth_app
docker service logs openhealth_database
```

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Verify database is ready
docker exec [container-id] pg_isready -U openhealth

# Check connection string
echo $DATABASE_URL
```

### Build Failures
```bash
# Clear Docker cache and rebuild
docker system prune -a
docker build --no-cache -f Dockerfile.production -t openhealth:latest .
```

### Port Conflicts
```bash
# Check if port 3000 is in use
netstat -tulpn | grep 3000
lsof -i :3000
```

## üîê Security Notes

Before deploying to production:
1. Generate new AUTH_SECRET: `openssl rand -base64 32`
2. Generate new ENCRYPTION_KEY: `openssl rand -base64 32`
3. Use strong database password
4. Enable HTTPS in production (add Traefik labels or nginx-proxy)
5. Review and restrict CORS settings if needed
